**TTM4115 - Final Project | EV-charger App** 
---------------------
We want to solve challenges in todayâ€™s EV-charger
market like reserving chargers, paying for the service in advance, calculating price / time-
estimates and displaying availability and functionality.

With the rise of EV-numbers on Norwegian roads, these types of systems are becoming 
progressively crucial to ensure effective and reliable charging and travel. For the user, 
functionalities like reservation and price-calculation make the process more intuitive and 
keeping track of data like availability and system-status is useful for the vendor.

We think these are important improvements to the charging process because they can have 
positive impacts on everything from the environment to the local users and communities. 
With potential economic benefits for both owners and users, we think the incentive for 
systems like ours is on the rise as well.

This application is a simplified representation of an eventual final product, presented by using a Raspberry Pi with a Sense HAT.
